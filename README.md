# 🧠 Amazon Customer Review Analytics

### Exploratory Text Analysis (ETA) & Sentiment Analysis using Natural Language Processing (NLP)

> **An end-to-end NLP project demonstrating how customer reviews can be transformed into actionable business insights using Exploratory Text Analysis and Sentiment Analysis.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project applies **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Data Analytics** techniques to analyze Amazon customer reviews and transform unstructured textual feedback into actionable business insights.

The project follows an end-to-end analytics workflow that includes data understanding, data cleaning, NLP preprocessing, Exploratory Text Analysis (ETA), Sentiment Analysis, Business Insights, and Strategic Recommendations.

Instead of relying only on product ratings, the analysis explores customer review text to understand customer opinions, identify recurring product features, measure customer satisfaction, and support evidence-based business decision-making.

# 🎯 Business Problem

E-commerce platforms receive thousands of customer reviews every day. While numerical ratings provide a general indication of customer satisfaction, they do not explain **why customers are satisfied or dissatisfied**.

Manually analyzing large volumes of textual reviews is time-consuming and often impractical.

This project addresses that challenge by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to automatically analyze customer reviews, identify sentiment, discover recurring discussion themes, and generate actionable business insights that support product improvement and customer-centric decision-making.

---

# 🎯 Project Objectives

The primary objective of this project is to transform unstructured Amazon customer reviews into meaningful business intelligence using Natural Language Processing (NLP).

Specifically, the project aims to:

- Analyze customer opinions expressed in textual reviews.
- Perform Exploratory Text Analysis (ETA) to identify frequently discussed topics.
- Measure customer sentiment using TextBlob sentiment analysis.
- Discover product strengths and recurring customer concerns.
- Generate business insights supported by analytical evidence.
- Provide strategic recommendations to improve customer satisfaction and product performance.

## 📈 Key Results

The analysis produced several meaningful findings regarding customer opinions, product performance, and overall customer satisfaction.

| Analysis | Key Finding |
|----------|-------------|
| Total Reviews Analyzed | **4,913** |
| Positive Reviews | **79.63%** |
| Neutral Reviews | **13.58%** |
| Negative Reviews | **6.80%** |
| Most Common Rating | **5 Stars** |
| Dominant Discussion Topics | Product performance, storage capacity, speed, compatibility, and reliability |
| Primary Sentiment Driver | Product functionality and dependable performance |

These results indicate that customers are generally satisfied with the product and primarily evaluate it based on its real-world performance rather than cosmetic features.

## 💼 Business Insights

The analytical findings demonstrate that customer reviews provide valuable information beyond numerical ratings.

Key business insights include:

- Customers exhibit a **high level of overall satisfaction**, with nearly **80%** of reviews expressing positive sentiment.
- **Product performance, reliability, and storage capacity** are the strongest drivers of customer satisfaction.
- **Device compatibility** significantly influences purchasing decisions and user experience.
- Negative reviews primarily highlight **product reliability, formatting, and recognition issues**, providing opportunities for product improvement.
- Natural Language Processing successfully transformed large volumes of unstructured customer feedback into actionable business intelligence.

These insights support data-driven decision-making across product development, quality assurance, marketing, and customer experience management.

---

## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations

Based on the analytical findings, the following strategic recommendations are proposed:

- Maintain high product performance and reliability.
- Strengthen quality assurance to reduce recurring product issues.
- Improve product compatibility guidance for customers.
- Continuously monitor customer reviews to identify emerging trends.
